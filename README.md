Sprint 1

    The forecast for Sprint 1 consists of a total of 53 story points. Many of these story points are in reference to setting up the project and organizing all tools needed. The main goal of this sprint was to have everyone linked to the Github and start to familiarize themselves with the Angular programming language and how it interacts with Firebase. This sprint also consisted of hard coding what we would like the application to look like. The next steps for thsi project are to make it dynamic and to have it begin fetching data from Firebase. The following images and links are references to this sprint.

    Scrum Goal:

    The goal of this scrum was to finalize a technogoly stack for application. Ayorinde has significant experience with Angular and recommended this programming language. Cameron and Zyhere are both well rounded in JavaScipt, which is a close cousin to TypeScriot, the language that Angular is written in. Cameron created the Github repository, while Ayorinde pushed the initial application to the repo. Zhyere created a Jira project and applied it to the Github repository. 
    
    Following this scrum, Zhyere is going to begin creating mockups of potential pages for the application. Ayorinde is tasked with hard coding the current view for the Angular project to begin testing out the application's interacts. Cameron is tasked with creating a Firebase project and, alongside Ayorinde, establishing a connection between the Angular application and Firestore cloud. 

    As the review of this scrum stands, the team does not see any potential issues that could impede upon moving forward with what was discussed today. Further development will begin to take place soon.

    Sprint 2

    OVERVIEW

        To begin this sprint, a total of 53 story points were decided upon. The majority of the story points were divided between creating and establishing the back-end portion of the application and the testing suite. Unfortunately, due to repository errors, the back-end story points were unable to be completed during this sprint iteration, however, through the use of Jira we have moved these story points to the third and final sprint. The testing suite portion of the story points were completed on time by Ayorinde Lawani and the evidence for the completed tests are below in both image and video format. The rest of the sprint, as well as the daily scrums, focused on final design documentation, which is also evidenced below under the "Daily Scrum" heading.

    SCRUM GOAL

        The goal of this scrum consisted of finalizing a front-end layout for our application. We decided on using a total of four different screens, which include the "Home", "Games", "Profile", and "Login / Sign up" screens. In order to minimize potential clutter, it was decided during one of the daily scrums to incorporate a navigation bar; this way, the user can easily toggle between screens instead of having to be redirected. The API portion of the application will deal assist in handling the "Home", "Games", and "Profile" screens. The data for these three screens will reside in Firebase's Firestore and will be fetched when needed. Also during this scrum, in order to match players effectively we will be using the Bartle test, which is a psychology test that, through a questionnaire will match players on their preferred playing style, preferences, and attitude.
