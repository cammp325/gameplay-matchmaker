Sprint 1

    The forecast for Sprint 1 consists of a total of 53 story points. Many of these story points are in reference to setting up the project and organizing all tools needed. The main goal of this sprint was to have everyone linked to the Github and start to familiarize themselves with the Angular programming language and how it interacts with Firebase. This sprint also consisted of hard coding what we would like the application to look like. The next steps for thsi project are to make it dynamic and to have it begin fetching data from Firebase. The following images and links are references to this sprint.

    Scrum Goal:

    The goal of this scrum was to finalize a technogoly stack for application. Ayorinde has significant experience with Angular and recommended this programming language. Cameron and Zyhere are both well rounded in JavaScipt, which is a close cousin to TypeScriot, the language that Angular is written in. Cameron created the Github repository, while Ayorinde pushed the initial application to the repo. Zhyere created a Jira project and applied it to the Github repository. 
    
    Following this scrum, Zhyere is going to begin creating mockups of potential pages for the application. Ayorinde is tasked with hard coding the current view for the Angular project to begin testing out the application's interacts. Cameron is tasked with creating a Firebase project and, alongside Ayorinde, establishing a connection between the Angular application and Firestore cloud. 

    As the review of this scrum stands, the team does not see any potential issues that could impede upon moving forward with what was discussed today. Further development will begin to take place soon.

    SCRUM GOAL

        The goal of the daily scrum was to provide a walk-through type session of how we are connecting the front-end environment to the back-end enviornment. The profile page of the application was the specific page used to demonstrate this capability.
